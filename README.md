# JiWER-CS

A modified version of the original JiWER library that provides per-language measures for code-switching (currently supporting Arabic-English).

## Usage:
python cli.py -r ref.txt -h hyp.txt -a

**Format for ref.txt and hyp.txt:** Each reference/hypothesis sentence should be on a new line


**Note:** The current code is spaghetti, it requires cleaning and refactoring
